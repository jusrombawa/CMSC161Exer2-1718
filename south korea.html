      Now this thing. This thing... Ngl this took me waaaaay longer than I wanted.
      Had to plot ALL the rectangles one by one in gimp then note ALL their coordinates.
      I didn't wanna have to manually compute ALL SEVENTY-TWO POINTS to convert them to WebGL's coordinate system though, so I did the only reasonable thing that a coder could do... code.
      Made a tiny little C program based around that formula I've been using.
      Why C? Idk really. I'm still a bit rusty on my JS (kahit web ang practicum ko asdfkmweori), not really comfortable with Perl or Python, R takes forever to install, idk why I didn't think of Java, gcc is built in with Linux... so C then.
      THEN I realized that I haven't coded in C in forever. Had to fumble a bit with it and break a few good coding guidelines (I didn't bother with file i/o, I didn't use malloc!!!), but hey, it works. Hahahaha
      It's here: https://github.com/jusrombawa/tinyutils it's coordconvert.c v1
      I should really convert this to JS, would make things a loooot more easier, but anyway...
      So I used the program to compute the points (manually again, because I was too tired/lazy not to use file i/o). And it worked...
      ... kinda. More or less they're right, but some points are a *little* off. Maybe from the plotting or the rounding off. Probably the plotting.
      Had to adjust all those wonky corners a bit. Okay, I tried, but they're definitely not perfect.
      And violin! I present this completely inaccurate and inefficient part.

      I really should've just used a couple bars then moved them around...

      ... but whatever. It's done. I'm done. Ugh I need a beer.

      I blame coffee for all this.
